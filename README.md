## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

- This was a simple and basic layout using HTML and CSS. And learning that is important, as understanding and creating the simple basic building blocks is the proper start to any Website.

- Learning a Workflow is easily one of the first biggest challenges I have unexpectedly run across. A Workflow encompasses many things. Such as:
 - - Settling on a consistent way to Format the code
 - - Deciding on Naming Conventions for files and folders
 - - How to approach the project
 - - What auxillary programs I often use and how to keep them readily available

 I have added a second monitor and found it to be a huge help. For starters it allows me to write code on one screen and view my page in a browser on the other screen. Beats flipping back and forth on the same screen. I would highly recommend another monitor if your finances, computer, and space allow it.
 
### Continued development

- A big challenge I need to overcome is to quit 'copying and pasting code' and to actually write the code in place when and where as needed.
